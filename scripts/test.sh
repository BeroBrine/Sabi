# Sabi - Recognition Tester Script
#
#     1. Selects a random song from the specified directory.
#     2. Calculates a random start time, avoiding the very beginning and end.
#     3. Plays a short snippet of the song in the background.
#     4. Immediately runs the 'recognise' command of the Rust project, which
#        listens while the snippet is playing.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - ffmpeg/ffplay: For audio processing and playback.
#     Installation:
#       - On macOS (Homebrew): brew install ffmpeg
#       - On Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install ffmpeg
#
# Usage:
#   1. Make sure you have songs in the 'songs' directory.
#   2. Run the script from your terminal: ./test_recognition.sh
